crunch jars were not present in the hadoop class path & task tracker class paths.
Hence needed to export jar using distributed cache.

export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/crunch/crunch-core.jar
javac -classpath `hadoop classpath` com/sumit/ncdc/programs/*.java
jar -cvf maxtempcrunch.jar com/sumit/ncdc/programs/*.class
hadoop fs -put /usr/lib/crunch/crunch-core.jar 
hadoop jar ./maxtempcrunch.jar com.sumit.ncdc.programs.MaxTemperatureCrunch 1901.txt 1901.txt.out
